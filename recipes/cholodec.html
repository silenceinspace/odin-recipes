        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>This dish will be an amazing addition to your winter holiday's table. My family usually makes <strong><em>Cholodec</em></strong> on Christmas at home, but we also manage to taste it at other different places.</p>
            <p>It might look weird a bit or for an unused eye not tasty enough, however I promise it is so damn delicious. It is the case especially in a combination with mushed potatoes and chrin.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="centered">
                <li>2 lb pork legs</li>
                <li>5-8 large chicken drumsticks</li>
                <li>2 medium onions</li>
                <li>1 large carrot</li>
                <li>1 stick of celery</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>5-10 peppercorns</li>
                <li>2 tsp salt + more to taste</li>
                <li>red horseradish sauce/chrin</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure you soak the pork legs in cold water (we put them in the fridge overnight which is also a good way to thaw them if you want to make it the next day).</li>
                <li>In a large pot, Add pork legs, and chicken drum sticks. Add enough water to cover all of the meat. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. As soon as it starts boiling, remove from heat and drain off the water.</li>
                <li>Rinse the meat, refill with fresh water (enough water to cover all of the meat, plus an extra 1/2-inch over the meat); Don't add too much water or it won't be “gelatiney” enough later.</li>
                <li>Cover and bring to a boil again.Reduce heat to a light boil/simmer and set a timer for 5 hours :-O. (I have a much greater appreciation for my mom's efforts in making holodets after watching my husband make this).</li>
                <li>After cooking for 5 hours, Add 1 large carrot, 2 medium onions (both ends removed), 1 celery stick, 2 bay leaves, 5-8 peppercorns and 2 tsp salt into the pot and continue boiling  on low heat 1 more hour. It should start to look like a nice chicken broth. Now it's important that you keep the broth (do not discard the broth!) and do not add more water.</li>
                <li>Remove the drumsticks and carrot from the broth and let them cool. Discard pork legs, onion and bay leaves. Use a fine mesh sieve with 3 bounty paper towels in the colander and filter the broth through the paper towels. You will be left with a clean broth.</li>
                <li>Peel and press 4 garlic cloves into the broth and do a taste test to see if more salt is needed.</li>
                <li>Once the meat has cooled, use a fork to separate meat from the bones. Keep the good meat; discard the rest. Thinly slice the carrot. You can make one big holodets in a rectangular pyrex dish or you can make smaller bowls.</li>
                <li>Start by placing carrots on the bottom and top with some dill if you wish. Next add the meat in an even layer and pour broth over the meat. You need enough broth to cover the meat and add a little extra over the top. Refrigerate 3 hours to overnight or until firm. Serve with red horseradish/hren or Russian mustard. Once it's set, set the bowl in hot water for a few seconds, then use a slim spatula to release the gelatin from the dish.</li>
