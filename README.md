# odin-recipes

This is officially my first project. I have kinda done a couple of things with tutorials, but never did I work like this on my own. It's a great opportunity to make sure that I am learning things well and am able to put them into practice.

What I am going to do:
I have a task to create my own webpage with a few recipes. For achieving the goal, I will be using different html elements (links, lists, images, headings) and attributes. I will also get to use git and github a bit more. 

What I have learned (once the project is finished):
- structure my project files (separate directories for images, webpages that are not index.html or readme)
- work with git (adding, committing, checking status, logging, pushing changes)
- work with github (creating and removing repositories, tracking changes - go to previous ones, having my webpages uploaded by github)
- meaning of the boilerplate concept (head element - metadata of my webpage, body element - info that is literally shown on the page, meta element - encoding, lang attribute, html element)
- html elements for text (paragraphs, headings, bold and italic fonts)
- order and unordered lists (+nesting info)
- links with absolute and relative paths (anchor element)
- images (their 4 main formats, manipulating with sizes, alt attribute)
- writing comments and thinking of different random ideas what else I can create on a webpage with the basics knowledge
- using tabs and spaces in IDE to organize my code more nicely

For the first project, I would rate my performance decently. I did enjoy the process of creating my own things regardless of how basic they are. It's such an addicting feeling, because I barely want to get distracted or take a break :D

This project is going to be improved in the near future with some creative CCS. So I am looking forward to learning how to add more layers to what I create!
