# odin-recipes

This is officially my first project. I have kinda done a couple of things with tutorials, but never did I work like this. It's a great opportunity to make sure that I learn things well and am able to put them into practice.

What I am going to do:
I have a task to create my own webpage with a few recipes. For achieving the goal, I will be using different html elements (links, lists, images, headings) and attributes. I will also get to use git and github a bit more. 

What I have learned: (once the project is finished)
